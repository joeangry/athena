# Athena

Design system inspired by software giants like [Microsofts FluentUI](https://developer.microsoft.com/en-us/fluentui/) and [Google Material](https://material.io/). My personal project for testing out various design ideas and getting hands on experience with frameworks like [Storybook](https://storybook.js.org/). All components are implemented in React.js. Great starting point for new projects.


## Athena

Athena is an ancient greek goddess of wisdom, handicraft, and warfare ([Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Athena)).
